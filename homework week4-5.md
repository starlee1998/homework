### PAYT——Promote the Decoupling of Waste Production from GDP Growth

PAYT, "Pay as You Throw" is first proposed by the United States.  Since 1924, when the city of Berkeley first imposed household waste treatment fee, other countries and regions have begun to follow suit. 

Nowadays, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Belgium and many other countries have established a garbage metering and charging system. Some scholars put waste metering and charging models into two categories: European and American type and Asia-Pacific type. In European and American countries, the community charging model represented by the United States and the mixed charging model represented by Germany are the most typical. The Asia-Pacific countries and regions are typically based on the bag-based charging model represented by Japan and South Korea.

According to previous experience, after the large-scale implementation of waste metering and charging system, the amount of per capita daily domestic waste will be significantly reduced, which to some extent realizes the reduction of waste source and becomes  an important measure to promote the decoupling of waste production from GDP growth.

In countries with long-term high GDP growth (such as China and India), waste production tends to "go hand in hand" with GDP in the natural state, maintaining a high rate of increase and causing many environmental problems. This requires government measures to break the link between the two and decouple the growth of waste production from GDP growth.

Since 2000, China attaches great importance to environmental issues and has introduced many policies that may be beneficial to the reduction of decoupling index.

Domestic garbage collection fees began in the late 20th century. In 2002, the four ministries and commissions jointly issued the “Notice on Implementing the Urban Garbage Disposal Charging System and Promoting the Industrialization of Waste Disposal”, which strongly advocated the collection of municipal solid waste disposal fees. However, China's garbage charges have not adopted a large-scale metering and charging model, but only in some areas for pilot exploration.

Ten years later, the then President Hu Jintao proposed the “Scientific Development View” in 2003, and the subsequent 11th Five-Year Plan also regards environmental protection as an important part. What’s more, a leading group for energy conservation and emission reduction led by Wen Jiabao was established. During this period, waste production was decoupled from GDP growth, which partly reflects the effectiveness of the policy.

Although initial results have been achieved, China’s current environmental and waste policies, including the recently-recognized “garbage classification” policy, are mainly focused on waste disposal, which is conducive to improving resource utilization, However, from the perspective of calculation, it has a limited effect on decoupling waste production from GDP growth.To achieve decoupling, we still need to reduce the source of waste.

In the past two years, the waste sorting system has gradually been introduced from the pilot to the whole country, creating conditions for waste metering and charging. The National Development and Reform Commission issued the "Opinions on Innovation and Improvement of the Price Mechanism for Promoting Green Development", proposing that before the end of 2020, cities and towns across the country will establish a comprehensive domestic garbage disposal fee system and conduct conditional metering charges.By then, people may actually consciously reduce waste generation for economic reasons.
