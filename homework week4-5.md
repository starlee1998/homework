### PAYT——Promote the Decoupling of Waste Production to GDP Growth

   We always want to produce more GDP while consuming less resources and producing less pollution. However, in countries with long-term high GDP growth (such as China and India), waste production tends to "go hand in hand" with GDP in the natural state, maintaining a high rate of increase and causing many environmental problems. This requires government measures to break the link between the two and decouple the growth of waste production from GDP growth.

   In recent years, China attaches great importance to environmental issues and has introduced many policies that may be beneficial to the reduction of decoupling index.Recognizing that the increasing resources and environmental pressures for sustainable development are the biggest challenges of the future economic development, the then President Hu Jintao proposed the “Scientific Development View” in 2003, and the subsequent 11th Five-Year Plan also regards environmental protection as an important part. What’s more, a leading group for energy conservation and emission reduction led by Wen Jiabao was established. During this period, waste production was decoupled from GDP growth, which partly reflects the effectiveness of the policy.

   Although initial results have been achieved, China’s current environmental and waste policies, including the recently-recognized “garbage classification” policy, are mainly focused on waste disposal, which is conducive to improving resource utilization, However, from the perspective of calculation, it has a limited effect on decoupling garbage production from GDP growth.To achieve decoupling, we need to reduce the source of garbage.
   
   Some countries adopt a system of garbage metering and charging to promote waste reduction. In layman's terms, it is “Pay as You Throw”——PAYT. Since 1924, when the city of Berkeley in the United States first imposed household waste treatment fee, other countries and regions have begun to follow suit and achieved good results. According to previous experience, after the large-scale implementation of waste metering and charging system, the amount of per capita daily domestic waste will be significantly reduced, which to some extent realizes the reduction of waste source.

   At present, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, Belgium and many other countries have established a garbage metering and charging system. Some scholars have found that the management of urban domestic garbage charges can be divided into two categories: European and American、Asia-Pacific . The typical European and American countries are the community charging model represented by the United States and the mixed charging model represented by Germany. The Asia-Pacific countries and regions are typically based on the bag-based charging model represented by Japan and South Korea.

   Domestic garbage collection fees began in the late 20th century. In 2002, the four ministries and commissions jointly issued the “Notice on Implementing the Urban Garbage Disposal Charging System and Promoting the Industrialization of Waste Disposal”, which strongly advocated the collection of municipal solid waste disposal fees. However, China's garbage charges have not adopted a large-scale metering and charging model, but only in some areas for pilot exploration.
   
   In the past two years, the waste sorting system has gradually been introduced from the pilot to the whole country, creating conditions for waste metering and charging. The National Development and Reform Commission issued the "Opinions on Innovation and Improvement of the Price Mechanism for Promoting Green Development", proposing that before the end of 2020, cities and towns across the country will establish a comprehensive domestic garbage disposal fee system and conduct conditional metering charges.

我们总是希望在生产更多GDP的同时，消耗更少的资源，产生更少的污染。然而在GDP长期高速增长的国家中（比如中国、印度），自然状态下的垃圾产量往往与GDP“齐头并进”，保持一个较高的速度增加，造成了许多环境问题。这就需要政府采取措施，打破两者之间的联系，实现垃圾产量增长与GDP增长的脱钩。

近年来，中国高度重视环境问题，出台了许多有利于降低脱钩指数的政策。由于认识到了可持续发展的资源和环境压力的增长是为了经济发展的最大挑战，时任国家主席的胡锦涛在2003年提出了“科学发展观”，随后的“十一五”规划也把环境保护作为重要工作内容，并成立了以温家宝总理为首的节能减排领导小组。在此期间，垃圾生产与GDP增长脱钩，这在一定程度上反映了国家政策的有效性。

虽然初见成效，但目前中国的环境措施和垃圾政策，包括最近受到广泛关注的“垃圾分类”政策，主要还是聚焦在了垃圾处理上，有利于提高资源利用率，但从计算层面来看对于实现垃圾产量与GDP增长的脱钩作用有限。想要实现脱钩，还要追求垃圾的源头减量化。

一些国家采取垃圾计量收费的制度来推动垃圾减量化，通俗的说就是“扔多少花多少”。自1924年美国伯克利市首先开始征收生活垃圾处理费之后, 其他国家和地区纷纷开始效仿这一举措，取得了不错的效果。根据以往经验，垃圾计量收费制度大规模实施后，人均每日生产生活垃圾的数量会明显下降，这在一定程度上实现了垃圾源头减量化。

目前日本、韩国、瑞典、德国、比利时等许多国家已经建立了垃圾计量收费体系，有学者研究发现，城市生活垃圾收费管理主要可以分为欧美型和亚太型两大类。欧美国家中比较典型的是以美国为代表的社区收费模式和以德国为代表的混合收费模式；而亚太国家和地区比较典型的是以日本，韩国为代表的按袋收费模式。

国内城市征收垃圾处理费始于20世纪末。2002年, 国家四部委联合发布了《关于实行城市垃圾处理收费制度, 促进垃圾处理产业化的通知》, 在文件中大力提倡征收城市生活垃圾处理费。但我国的垃圾收费一直未大规模采取计量收费的模式，只是在一些地区试点，进行探索。

近两年，垃圾分类制度逐渐从试点向全国推行，为垃圾计量收费创造了条件。国家发展改革委发布《关于创新和完善促进绿色发展价格机制的意见》，提出在2020年底前，全国城市及建制镇全面建立生活垃圾处理收费制度，并进行有条件的计量收费。
